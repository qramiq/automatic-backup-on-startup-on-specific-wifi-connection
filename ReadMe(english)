Prerequisites:

Your script (.ps1) is already saved, and you have adjusted the paths to the script as well as the Wi-Fi name (SSID) in your PowerShell script, such as:

    Wi-Fi Name: The value $expectedWifi = "Your Wifi" must match the actual name of your Wi-Fi network.
    Backup Path: The source and destination paths in the script must also be adjusted to the correct folders on your system.

Steps to set up via MMC with Group Policy

    Open MMC (Microsoft Management Console) and add the "Group Policy Object" Snap-In:
        Press Windows key + R, type mmc, and press Enter.
        In the MMC window, click on File > Add/Remove Snap-in.
        Select Group Policy Object Editor from the list and click Add.
        Click OK.

    Choose the appropriate Group Policy Object:
        If you want to create a new group policy for a specific user group, you can do so directly in Active Directory or for the local computer.
        In MMC, click on Group Policy Object and then click Edit to configure the GPO for the user or computer.
        To run the script at login, select User Settings.

    Navigate to the User Configuration Settings:
        In the Group Policy Editor, navigate to:

    User Configuration > Windows Settings > Scripts (Logon/Logoff)
        In the right pane, click Logon.
        In the window that appears, you can now add a script.

    Add the PowerShell script for logon:
        Click Add, then click Browse.
        Navigate to the location of your .ps1 file (e.g., C:\Path\to\your\BackupScript.ps1).
        Click Open.

And as arguments, enter the following command:

-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\to\your\BackupScript.ps1"

    Save and Close:
        Click OK to add the script.
        Close the Group Policy Editor and save the changes.

    Update Group Policy:
        To apply the changes immediately, either restart the computer or run the command gpupdate /force in an administrative command prompt.

Important Notes:

    Adjust Wi-Fi name: In the script itself, ensure that the $expectedWifi value matches the name of your Wi-Fi network. If you're connected to a different network, the script will not execute the backup operation.
    Adjust Backup Paths: Make sure the paths for the sourcePath and destinationPath are set correctly. For example, if the source directory points to C:\Backuptest, make sure the folder exists. The same applies to the destination folder on the external hard drive (D:\Backup).
    Execution Policies: The argument -ExecutionPolicy Bypass allows the PowerShell script to run even if local execution policies for PowerShell scripts are restricted.
